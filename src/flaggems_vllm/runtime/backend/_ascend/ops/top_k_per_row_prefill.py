"""Ascend-specialized top_k_per_row_prefill (DeepSeek V4 sparse attention).

Routes (per-row, resolved inside the threshold kernel from row_len; the
host launches one pipeline that serves all of them):

  trivial     row_len <= TOPK.  Every element wins; the row is copied out
              directly, padded with -1.  No sampling, no packing.
  select_all  row_len <= CAP.   All elements fit the candidate buffer, so
              the threshold degenerates to -inf and K2-K5 run on an
              all-ones mask.  No sampling.
  sampled     row_len > CAP.    K1 estimates a threshold from a sorted
              sample (plus a +-6-sigma bracket pair for fixup), K2-K5
              count/compact/sort the survivors.
  rowsort     launch-level route for narrow rows (k == 512,
              vocab <= 6144, any batch size): one exact-width hardware
              sort per row (a subview of the pow2 load buffer keeps
              ragged tails out of the sort), unpacked in-kernel — no
              proposal round-trip, no merge.  Beats the sampled pipeline
              2-7x on narrow rows (measured); the last two rows read from
              a -inf-padded scratch (masked lanes still issue addresses).
  segsort     launch-level route for medium rows (k == 512,
              6144 < vocab <= 32768) in small batches (rows <= 64):
              fixed-width (2048/4096) segment sorts + a two-level 4-way
              exhaustion merge.  2 launches beat the 7-launch sampled
              pipeline while the batch is latency-bound (probe).
  fixup       sampled rows whose survivor count at the threshold lands
              outside [TOPK, CAP] (degenerate distributions).  Exact
              tie-fill / bit-descent reselection in one kernel; rare.
  chunked     launch-level route for top_k > CHUNK_K: ceil(top_k/CHUNK_K)
              consecutive rounds of the threshold pipeline, each emitting
              up to CHUNK_K indices at a column offset.  A lexicographic
              (value, position) bound recorded by a boundary kernel
              excludes everything earlier rounds emitted, so ties can
              neither duplicate nor lose elements across rounds.

Design notes (all numbers measured on 910B-4, CANN 9.0, triton 3.5.1):

- Global-memory histogram atomics and shared-memory scratch (generic impl)
  are pathologically slow (~110ms/row).
- Backend cost model measured with micro-benchmarks and msprof
  PipeUtilization: this backend issues per-lane address arithmetic and
  per-lane load/store on the SCALAR pipe, and lowers tl.sum/tl.cumsum to
  scalar add chains. Dense affine load/store are full-width vector ops
  (memory-bound, nearly free); fp32 compares are free. Therefore:
  * all hot-path reductions use split+add trees (reshape (G,W)->(G,W/2,2)
    -> tl.split -> add, log2(W) levels) which run on the vector pipe —
    measured 184us -> 7us scalar on the pack counting workload;
  * trees only lower correctly from dense (affine) loads and within a
    single control-flow scope — the partial tail tile lives in a separate
    kernel (_ascend_topk_pack_tail_kernel);
  * no tl.cumsum in hot passes, no scatter stores in hot passes (they
    scalarize per lane).
- fp32->fp16 conversion lowers to slow scalar code; unsigned shifts must
  be emulated with mask + arithmetic shift (FlagTree issue #1121).
- The backend compiler loses store->load dependencies inside a mega-kernel
  (program 0 at grid>=64 read back its own stores), so intermediate
  results cross kernel boundaries; counts and exclusive bases live in
  separate buffers and the segment base table is derived from registers.
- One dense pass over 32 rows x 129280 fp32 takes ~55us (300GB/s
  aggregate), vs ~265us for torch.topk. The pipeline touches the full row
  once (pack); extraction works on the packed masks only:

  K1 threshold  Per row, DMA-copy 4 evenly spaced 1024-tiles into UB and
               hardware-sort them (sort_1d_pack raw op); the exact sample
               quantile at rank ~2x TOPK becomes the mask threshold, with
               a +-6-sigma bracket pair stored alongside for the fixup
               path's reselection.  Short rows (row_len <= TOPK) are
               copied out directly, padded with -1.
  K2 pack      One full-row pass (rows x C blocks): order-preserving
               compares against the threshold (exactly representable
               floats), bit-pack one mask per 64-element subtile and
               store per-subtile counts (all via split+add trees).
               The partial tail tile is packed by separate tiny kernels
               (K2t dense window + K2s partial subtile).
  K3 reduce    Per-row sum -> L, the route decision (0: L in
               [TOPK, CAP], 2: fixup) and the exclusive 4096-segment
               bases of the mask.
  K4 compact   grid (rows x NSEG): per 4096-segment, two vreducev2 calls
               (gather_mask_custom_pattern custom op) compact candidate
               values and positions against the padded mask words (no
               scalar GM access), emitting a compact (value, index)
               candidate list.  The mask words are stored in the padded
               vreducev2 layout: the 2 words of each 64-element subtile
               head a 32-byte block (8 words); the hardware reads only
               those 64 bits per repeat (probe-verified with poisoned
               pads).
  K5 sort      grid (rows): one sort_1d_pack over the <=CAP candidates
               (hardware vbitsort/vmrgsort4 via the TLE custom ops) +
               unpack + tl.gather (hivm.vgather) index remap writes
               exactly TOPK indices.  Skips fixup rows.
  K6 fixup     Route-2 rows only (launched when the device-side flag
               fires; the reduce kernel ORs per-row flags via
               atomic_max).  The bracket threshold is picked by
               direction: L < TOPK -> thr_lo, L > CAP -> thr_hi.
               Typical case (massive tie at one value): strict/tie fill,
               3 read passes.  Otherwise a 32-pass descent over the
               unsigned rank of the order-preserving int32 fp32-bit
               mapping finds the exact top-k boundary value.

All custom ops (sort_1d_pack / unpack_sort / gather_mask_custom_pattern)
are registered by FlagTree's triton.experimental.tle.language.dsa.ascend.
